# **CUThere**

## What is CUThere?

CUThere is a tool made for CU students and faculty to schedule and organize events on one consolidated site. It includes:
* a user login system with varying degrees of privilege
* a map of University of Colorado's campus, using the Google Maps API
* a list of events and their details, which include among other things, an optional description, date and time, and an address
* a search page
* an application page
* a page for deleting/canceling an event

## Deployment

There are two ways to deploy the project. The first way is to visit the website: http://cuthere.herokuapp.com/. The second way is to download the zip file "Murphy's Law 12-2-19.zip" and install it locally (Node.JS must be installed): 

```
$ cd ../Murphy's Law/CUThere
$ node server.js
```
